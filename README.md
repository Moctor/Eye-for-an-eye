Eye for an eye is a 2D platformer created during the KISS Game Jam.  
Inspired by Jump King, this game flips the concept: instead of climbing to the top, you must descend through platforms filled with traps and enemies.  

Controls
- Z → Jump  
- Q / D → Move left / right  
- S → Drop down from platforms  

My Contribution
Developed as part of a small team during the KISS Game Jam.  
I was responsible for:
- Implementing the enemies (except the boss)  
- Creating the trap mechanics  
- Balancing difficulty related to these elements
